注意在初始化的时候生成Counter实例，否则超时
```
class WordsFrequency:

    def __init__(self, book: List[str]):
        self.dic  = collections.Counter(book)
        

    def get(self, word: str) -> int:
        return self.dic[word]
        


# Your WordsFrequency object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordsFrequency(book)
# param_1 = obj.get(word)
```
