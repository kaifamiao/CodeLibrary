先通过一次关联查询把每组每个player的总分查出来，再通过一次查询得到每组得分最高的，得分一样的取id最小的
```
select group_id,player_id from 
(select group_id,player_id,sum((
    case when player_id = first_player then first_score
         when player_id = second_player then second_score
         end
)) as totalScores
from Players p,Matches m
where p.player_id = m.first_player
or p.player_id = m.second_player
group by group_id,player_id
order by group_id,totalScores desc,player_id) as temp
group by group_id
order by group_id,totalScores desc,player_id
```
